# AntiDebug/AntiVM

## Purpose

This repository hosts the different debug/vm detection methods I have come across whilst looking through the WinAPI. This is not intended to be compiled and ran but rather to show examples of how to implement these different methods into your existing projects. Each file in the `AntiDBG` and `AntiVM` folder can be looked at independently, which is also the reason why `GetModuleHandle` is used.
